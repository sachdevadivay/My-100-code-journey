//Q102: Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.


#include <stdio.h>

int findCeil(int arr[], int n, int x) {
    int low = 0, high = n - 1;
    int result = -1;

    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;

        if (arr[mid] >= x) {
            result = mid;     
            high = mid - 1;   
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int x;

    scanf("%d", &x);

    int index = findCeil(arr, n, x);

    printf("%d", index);

    return 0;
}
