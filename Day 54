//Q104: Write a Program to take a positive integer n as input, and find the pivot integer x such that the sum of all elements between 1 and x inclusively equals the sum of all elements between x and n inclusively. Print the pivot integer x. If no such integer exists, print -1. Assume that it is guaranteed that there will be at most one pivot integer for the given input.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int pivotInteger(int n) {
    int val = n * (n + 1) / 2;   
    int x = sqrt(val);

    if (x * x == val)
        return x;

    return -1;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);

    printf("%d", pivotInteger(n));
    return 0;
}
